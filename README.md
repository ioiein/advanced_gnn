# Advanced Graph Neural Networks course

This repository contains labs and practical assignments on Advanced Graph Neural Networks course.

Labs:
1. [Self-supervised learning on graphs](lab_ssl_on_graphs/lab.ipynb)
2. [Subgraph embeddings](lab_subgraph_emb/lab.ipynb)
3. [Scalable GNN](lab_scalable_gnn/lab.ipynb)
4. [Knowledge distillation for GNN](lab_knowledge_distillation/lab.ipynb)
5. [Deep generative graph models](lab_deep_generation/lab.ipynb)
6. [Interpretable explanations for GNN](lab_explainable_gnn/lab.ipynb)
7. [Recommender systems based on GNN](lab_recsys/lab.ipynb)
8. [Temporal graph embeddings](lab_temporal_gnn/lab.ipynb)
9. [Query embeddings for knowledge graphs](lab_multihop/lab.ipynb)
10. [Combinatorial optimization using GNN](lab_combinatorial_opt/lab.ipynb)

All assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks, that can be done by writing code instead of the line
```
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
All notebooks contain test cells with assert statements that help you understand whether your code is correct.

Assignments:
1. [Graph contrastive learning](assignment_contrastive_learning/assignment.ipynb)
2. [Deep recurrent graph generation](assignment_recurrent_generation/assignment.ipynb)
3. [Knowledge graphs for recommender systems](assignment_multihop/assignment.ipynb)
4. [Multi-Hop logical reasoning in knowledge graphs](assignment_contrastive_learning/assignment.ipynb)
